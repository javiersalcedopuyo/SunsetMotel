# Sunset Motel
:es: :gb: 

My very first game using Unity.

A road trip in the future joins 2 people, a nomad IA that inhabits a hover-car and a sarcastic cyborg coming home. Bad and cheesy jokes, a lot of references to old pop culture and different dialogs, depending on the route you take. 

Just, choose the music, relax and enjoy the trip.

Written in English and Spanish, and available in Windows and Linux.
